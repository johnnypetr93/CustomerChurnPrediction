My collaborative Masters' Thesis with Martin Bobula (https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-bobula/). Our thesis was based on Kaggle Competition: WSDM - KKBox's Churn Prediction Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge). I was in charge of coding while Martin was in charge of literature review and marketing theory. <br><br>

Unfortunately, the original Python notebooks are long gone. But here's a couple of notable code snippets from the Thesis. <br><br>

1) Transforming customer behavior over the span of 59 days into a heatmap. Effectively turning this into an image classification problem. <br> <img src="imgs/Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 21.43.32.png" width="700">

2) Example of active user versus inactive user behavior represented via the heatmap. <br> <img src="imgs/Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 21.43.42.png" width="500">

3) Our DNN model: <br> <img src="imgs/Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 21.44.04.png" width="700">

4) Visual representation of our model: <br> <img src="imgs/Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 21.44.17.png" width="700">

5) Confusion matrix: <br> <img src="imgs/Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 21.44.35.png" width="500">

6) Model accuracy over epochs: <br> <img src="imgs/Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 21.44.45.png" width="500">
